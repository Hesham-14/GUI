# GUI
This is a simple application using python GUI
There are Two .py files here:
  - First one (Function Plotter GUI) is working very well, with a pop-up plot window.
  - Second one (Unfinished Function Plotter GUI) have a built-in plot space, but still need some resizing work to make it more efficient.
